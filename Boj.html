          <h2>Boj Mobile App</h2>
          <h4 class="mb-2">SI 622 - Needs Assessment and Usability</h4>
          <p>
            Over the course of the semester, I worked with
            <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/boj">Boj</a>, a
            Detroit-based startup that matches employers with job and internship
            seekers that match their culture and values. Boj is currently
            embarking on a major redevelopment of their product in order to
            succeed in the saturated job-matching industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the semester, I was able to apply various user experience
            research using a variety of methodologies, including a
            <b
              >heuristic evaluation, needs assessment, comparative evaluation,
              concept test, usability test, and surveys.</b
            >
          </p>

          </div>

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Interview Research</h4>
          <p>
            Since Boj has been primarily focused on college students, I reached
            out to current students who have used job-matching service before.
            However, since Boj is expanding its reach, I also reached out to
            recent graduates and individuals looking for a full-time job. I
            helped conduct 4 interviews with 2 students looking for an
            internship as well as 2 working professionals. The goal of the
            interview was to better understand the needs, criteria, and pain
            points of users when actively seeking a job or internship.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Comparative Evaluation</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to conducting research through interviews, I analyzed
            <b>13 job-seeking services</b>, with a focus on each app’s sign up,
            profile/resume creation process, and job application tracking. Our
            team also generated tables and visual reports to provide better
            insights into these results.

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Survey</h4>
          <p>
            Next, a survey was deployed to ensure the interview data was fully
            representative. In addition, I wanted to gather data about the
            important factors users look for when they search for a job or
            internship, including the following questions:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              What features do users find useful or enjoyable across different
              types of job-service applications?
            </li>
            <li>
              What sort of devices do users use when looking for a job or
              internship?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are users okay with having interactive games to complete their
              profile or match with companies?
            </li>
          </ul>

            </div>
          </div>
          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
          <p>
            Next, a heuristic evaluation was conducted for Boj's mobile iOS app.
            Using <b>Nielsen’s usability heuristic evaluation</b> to conduct the
            comprehensive usability evaluation, I evaluated the app using a
            ranking system that prioritizes the major issues based on their
            severity. Afterwards, I conducted an interpretation session to
            identify and consolidate the the most pressing issues and key
            findings, and to brainstorm solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            After examining Nielsen’s 10 key heuristic criteria, Insight
            Research has determined that the functionality of the app could be
            improved by addressing several minor issues that presented
            themselves during the analysis. These issues, in order of severity,
            are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users are not presented with error messages when completing their
              profile
            </li>
            <li>
              The only documentation for help, or “tips” is difficult to
              navigate and understand
            </li>
            <li>
              On some sections, users would have to restart their inputs if they
              made a mistake or would want to change something in the future
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Concept Test</h4>
          <p>
            Since I was not able to gather any meaningful data about Boj's idea
            of implementing gamification on our surveys, I decided to conduct a
            concept test to ask users about how they feel about different
            gamification features, including examples like skills assessments,
            badges, neuroscience-based games, and personality questions.
          </p>
          <p>Our findings are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Participants are less likely to spend time playing a games (1-5
              minutes) but are willing to spend more time (15-20 minutes) with
              assessments and personality quizzes
            </li>
            <li>
              Many participants expressed concern over biases and discriminatory
              results of implementing gamification in a job-matching service
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">Usability Test</h4>
          <p>
            Since Boj currently faces high fall-off rates during the sign-up
            process, I wanted to investigate why this might be happening so they
            can improve on these issues during the redevelopment process. I
            helped conduct a usability test with five participants of different
            education majors who have searched for a job or internship within
            the past year. Four tasks were centered around profile creation and
            exploration. Upon completion, participant's feedback were recorded.
            The findings are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Profile creation can be difficult and overwhelming for users.
              Required fields aren’t clearly identified and users don’t like
              having to fill out excessive information. This might explain the
              high falloff rates Boj has experienced in the past.

            <li>
              Users were confused and frustrated with the lack of profile
              customization and options. College-specific categories aren’t
              fully representative of the college experience and lack fields
              such as leadership roles and clubs. Profiles also lack fields that
              cater to professionals.
            </li>

            <li>
              Users found editing their profile was confusing.Users want their
              prior selections to be remembered within the Boj App instead of
              having to re-enter existing fields every time they make a new
              change.

            Overall, Boj was given the following suggestions on how to tackle
            various aspects of their mobile app and service:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Boj should improve their profile creation by clearly identifying
              required fields and removing any non-essential questions that
              might hinder a user from signing up. If additional information is
              needed from users, look at other methods of collecting it
              (notifications, e-mails, alerts, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Since so many users use a traditional computer to apply for jobs,
              Boj should focus on creating a web-based version of their service
              instead of relying solely on a mobile app
            </li>
            <li>
              If gamification is implemented, look at implementing assessments
              that last no longer than 15-20 minutes. Be transparent about how
              assessments will be utilized by employers.
